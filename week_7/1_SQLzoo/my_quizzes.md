### Reflection
This was my very first exposure to SQL, and so far I am enjoying it. While there are a great
deal of new words to learn, I'm finding it on the whole a logical and straightforward language.
I can definitely see the use of using it, as it seems like it will be a great way to extract specific
pieces of information from a database to use in ruby code.
