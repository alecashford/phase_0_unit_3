This was a fairly straightforward challenge. It was not much harder than the previous databases we have already created. I really see the value of databases, although I wish there were an easier and faster way to input information. The text based method makes it easy to integrate with other pieces of code, but when you're setting up a database it'd be helpful to have a graphical interface.
